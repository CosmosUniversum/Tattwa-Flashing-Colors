# Tattwa Flashing Colors

## Objective:
 - Create an app that assists in the open eyed concentration exercise to induce an after-image from the book <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wsEa3zo1lG3PTiGSVwJYxGJUmPxyRm_4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Magical Tattwa Cards - A Complete System for Self-Development.</a>(page 31)
---
## How to use the App:
- You can select a background color for the cards. The default background is set to white as it is easier to see after images on a white background.
- <strong>Select a card</strong> from the area with multiple cards and shapes on them.
- The selected card will come up to the empty outlined card section.
- Once the card has been selected and is showing as the main card, <strong>select a timer</strong>.
  - I would suggest starting at 30 seconds to get used to the exercise first.
- Once a card has been selected and timer has been set, click the <strong>Start</strong> button and the timer will begin to countdown.
---
## The Exercise
- Gently stare at the center of the image imagining that there is a dot there.
- As time goes on you will notice an Aura begin to take form around the shapes and becomes more pronounced the longer the time goes.
- Continue staring at the center gently, remembering not to strain yourself and once the timer has reached zero it will begin to count up and the inner shapes will be removed and you are just left with the blank background of the card.
- Notice that you still see the image of the shapes you were looking at but the color of these after-image shapes are now the opposite color on the color wheel.
- Hold on to this image for as long as you can and once it has faded away press the <strong>stop</strong> button to stop the timer.
- Type the color in the text field <strong>"Type Flashed Color"</strong> and then click the <strong>Log Results</strong> button to log the Card, Color, and Time in a list.
  - ** A feature to save these results will be implemented into a future update.

## The Purpose<br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wsEa3zo1lG3PTiGSVwJYxGJUmPxyRm_4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Magical Tattwa Cards</a> are actually a much more in depth system involving elements, aspects of psychology, evolution, and more estoric topics as well.<br>
The purpose of this exercise is to train your visualization abilities. As you will see after practicing for some time, you can more easily hold on to the after-image and for a longer period of time.<br>
The benefits of having stronger visualization skills are far and wide but the premise is that you have a simple exercise that can specifically target a fundamental aspect of visualization.

## The App

## Prototype View:
Here is the wire frame of how the App was to be set up.<br>
There are definitely less features on the actual deployed page because I realized there needs to be a basic understanding of the Tattwa system to make full use of the training mode. This would make full use of the preset card list filters and choices section.

## Psuedocode:
- Create Card Grid with card images
- Create Card theme cards to switch card background
- Click card in card grid to make main card
- Create countdown timer that will count up after reaching zero
- Once countdown timer reaches zero, remove shapes from main card
- Create a dropdown menu to select preset timer
- Create log list that records the user's selected card, after-image color and time
---
## Minimum Viable Product:
- As a user, I should know what the app is for and how to use it.
- As a user, I should have a timer that clears the shapes for me.
- As a user, I should have a way to record my times and results to look back on them.

---
## Stretch Goals:
- Create a method to save results
- Show a description of main card once clicked
- Create a randomize card button
- Create a mode to memorize the names of each card
- Create a flashing mode for a different type of exercise
- Create a filter list to filter card list by shapes/colors
- Create a mode that uses the sanskrit names of cards making memorization more difficult
- Create a scrying and divination feature for advanced Tattwa users and for fun
- Add Mobile Responsiveness
- Make as a downloadable App
